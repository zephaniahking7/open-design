# tools/AGENTS.md

Follow the root `AGENTS.md` first. This file only records module-level boundaries for `tools/`.

## Active tools

- `tools/dev` provides `@open-design/tools-dev` and the `tools-dev` bin. It is the only currently active local development lifecycle control plane.
- `pnpm tools-dev` manages daemon -> web -> desktop.
- `pnpm tools-dev run web` runs foreground daemon + web for the Playwright webServer flow.
- `pnpm tools-dev inspect desktop ...` inspects the desktop runtime through sidecar IPC.
- `tools/pack` provides `@open-design/tools-pack` and the `tools-pack` bin. The active slice is packaged artifact build/install/start/stop/logs/uninstall/cleanup/list/reset plus beta release artifact preparation for mac and Windows lanes.

## Packaging scope

- Keep `tools-pack` focused on packaging/runtime control and release artifact preparation. Runtime updater product integration remains a later phase.
- Pack-specific Electron builder resources belong under `tools/pack/resources/`; do not reference app/docs/download assets directly from pack logic.
- Namespace controls packaged data/log/runtime/cache paths. Ports are transient transport details and must not participate in path decisions.
- The package/build boundary of root `pnpm build` is intentionally unchanged in this round and should be handled by the future `tools-pack` task.

## Orchestration boundary

- Orchestration layers must consume primitives from `@open-design/sidecar-proto`, `@open-design/sidecar`, and `@open-design/platform`.
- Do not hand-build `--od-stamp-*` args, process-scan regexes, runtime tokens, process roles, or duplicate namespace/source args in `tools/dev`, future `tools/pack`, or packaged launchers.
- Port flags are authoritative inputs: `--daemon-port` and `--web-port`. Internal env vars are `OD_PORT` and `OD_WEB_PORT`; do not introduce `NEXT_PORT`.
