# Impeccable CLI

Detect UI anti-patterns and design quality issues from the command line. Scans HTML, CSS, JSX, TSX, Vue, and Svelte files for 27 specific patterns including AI-generated UI tells, accessibility violations, and general design quality problems.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install skills into your AI harness (Claude, Cursor, Gemini, etc.)
npx impeccable skills install

# Update skills to the latest version
npx impeccable skills update

# List all available commands
npx impeccable skills help

# Scan files or directories for anti-patterns
npx impeccable detect src/

# Scan a live URL (requires Puppeteer)
npx impeccable detect https://example.com

# JSON output for CI/tooling
npx impeccable detect --json src/

# Regex-only mode (faster, no jsdom)
npx impeccable detect --fast src/
```

## What It Detects

**AI Slop Tells**: patterns that scream "AI generated this":
- Side-tab accent borders, gradient text on headings
- Purple/violet gradients and cyan-on-dark palettes
- Dark mode with glowing accents, border + border-radius clashes

**Typography Issues**: overused fonts (Inter, Roboto), flat type hierarchy, single font families

**Color & Contrast**: WCAG AA violations, gray text on colored backgrounds, pure black/white

**Layout & Composition**: nested cards, monotonous spacing, everything-centered layouts

**Motion**: bounce/elastic easing, layout property transitions

**Quality**: tiny body text, cramped padding, long line lengths, small touch targets

25 detections in total. See the full list at [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style).
